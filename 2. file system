Linux organizes its file system in a hierarchical structure, with everything starting from the root directory (/).

1. / (Root Directory)
   - The top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy. All files and directories originate from the root.
   - Only the root user has permission to modify the contents of the root directory

2. /bin (Essential User Binaries)
   - Contains essential binaries (programs) required for the system to boot and run basic commands.
   - Commands like ls, cat, cp, and mv are located here.

3. /sbin (System Binaries)
   - Holds system binaries, primarily used by the root or administrative users.
   - Includes commands for system administration like reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, and iptables.

4. /etc (Configuration Files)
   - Contains configuration files for the system and services.
   - Each service or application may have a corresponding configuration file or directory in /etc.
   - For example, the passwd file storing user account information is located at /etc/passwd.
   - Configuration files for the web server might reside in /etc/nginx/.

5. /home (User Home Directories)
  - Each user gets a personal directory under /home.
  - For example, user alice has a home directory /home/alice
  - This directory stores user-specific files, settings, and documents.

6. /root (Root User's Home Directory)
   - The home directory for the root user (the superuser). Not to be confused with the root directory /.
   - It’s a private directory where the root user can store their files and configuration settings.

7. /lib (Essential Shared Libraries)
   - Contains shared libraries (similar to DLL files in Windows) needed by the essential binaries in /bin and /sbin
   - Typically, you’ll see subdirectories like /lib/modules for kernel modules.

8. /usr (User Programs)
   - Stands for "User System Resources" and contains applications and utilities used by regular users.
   - Includes several subdirectories:
     1./usr/bin: Non-essential user binaries, like programs and commands.
     2.Includes applications like text editors (vim, nano) and compilers (gcc).

  - /usr/sbin: Non-essential system binaries for the root user, like administrative commands.
  - /usr/lib: Shared libraries for programs located in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
  - /usr/local: Used for locally compiled software, not installed by the system package manager

9. /var (Variable Files)
   - Contains files that are expected to grow or change frequently, like logs and temporary files.
   - Key subdirectories
     1. /var/log: Contains log files, such as /var/log/syslog or /var/log/auth.log.
     2. /var/lib: Stores dynamic information for programs, like databases for services
     3. /var/lib: Stores dynamic information for programs, like databases for services
     4. /var/www: Default location for web server files.

10. /tmp (Temporary Files)
    - Used to store temporary files created by system processes or user programs.
    - Files stored in /tmp are typically deleted on reboot.

11. /dev (Device Files)
    - Contains device files, which represent hardware devices.
    - For example, /dev/sda represents a hard drive, and /dev/tty represents terminal devices.
    - Devices in Linux are treated as files, allowing you to interact with them using standard file I/O.

12. /mnt and /media (Mount Points)
    - /mnt: Used as a temporary mount point where you can mount filesystems or external devices manually.
    - /media: Where removable media (like USB drives or CDs) are automatically mounted by the system.

13. /opt (Optional Software)
   - Used for the installation of additional or optional software packages.
   - Many third-party programs are installed here, like custom or non-distribution software.
   
14. /boot (Boot Loader Files)
    - Contains all files required for booting the system, including the kernel and initial RAM disk.
    - /boot/vmlinuz: The Linux kernel.
    - boot/grub: Files for the GRUB boot loader
    
15. /proc (Process Information)
    - A virtual filesystem that contains runtime system information about processes and system resources.
    - Files under /proc are dynamically generated by the kernel and provide details about running processes, memory, CPU, etc.
    - /proc/cpuinfo: Information about the CPU.
    - /proc/meminfo: Memory information
    - /proc/<PID>: Contains details about individual processes (with <PID> being the Process ID).

16. /sys (System Information)
    - Another virtual filesystem, like /proc, but focuses on providing information about devices, drivers, and kernel modules.
    - Used by the system to interact with and configure hardware components.

17. /srv (Service Data)
    - Stores data for services provided by the system, such as web servers or file servers.
    - For example, data for an HTTP service might be stored in /srv/www.

18. /run (Run-Time Variable Data)
    - Holds runtime information and files like process IDs, sockets, and other temporary data that is required by processes after booting.
    - It’s typically used by services and daemons.

19. /lost+found (Recovered Files)
    - Found on each filesystem partition, used by the fsck tool to store recovered files after a system crash or filesystem corruption.
    - Not typically accessed by users.

20. /swap (Swap Space)
    - Though not represented as a directory, swap space is part of the filesystem layout.
    - It is a partition or file on disk used as virtual memory to swap out processes when the RAM is full.
